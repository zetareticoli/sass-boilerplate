# sass-boilerplate

## What is this
A simple boilerplate for Sass projects using ITCSS Methodology.

For each new project I set up I keep finding myself creating the same directory and @import file structure. To speed things up I've generated this repo as a quick and easy starting point.

This isn't a Sass framework. There is no actual SCSS or CSS included, it's just a bare-bones directory and @import file structure.
